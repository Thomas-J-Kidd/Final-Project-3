# NAFNET Training Improvements

## Changes Made

I have made the following modifications to improve your NAF-DPM training process:

### 1. Training Stability Improvements

- **Reduced beta_loss from 50 to 10**
  - The original high value (50) was likely causing training instability
  - This parameter balances initial prediction loss and denoiser loss
  - A more moderate value should lead to more stable convergence

- **Added gradient clipping**
  - Implemented gradient norm clipping (max_norm=1.0) for both the initial predictor and denoiser networks
  - This prevents extreme parameter updates that can cause oscillations in training

### 2. Validation Performance Optimization

- **Reduced validation sample count**
  - Changed `VALIDATE_ITERATIONS` from 1000 to 20
  - This dramatically reduces validation time while still providing meaningful quality metrics

- **Reduced DPM Solver steps**
  - Changed `DPM_STEP` from 10 to 5 for faster sampling during validation
  - Validation will run approximately twice as fast with minimal impact on metric accuracy

### 3. Checkpoint Frequency

- **More frequent model saving**
  - Changed `SAVE_MODEL_EVERY` from 5000 to 1000 iterations
  - This provides more recovery points if training becomes unstable

## Expected Outcomes

With these changes, you should experience:

1. **More stable training progress** with less oscillation in the loss values
2. **Much faster validation cycles** (possibly 50-100x faster)
3. **More frequent checkpoints** for better recovery options

## How to Run

To start training with these improvements:

```bash
./run_gopro_nafnet_rgb.sh train
```

The training will now proceed with the improved configuration. The validation phase should complete much faster than before, and the overall training should be more stable.

## Monitoring

Continue monitoring the loss values during training. You should see:
- A more steady decrease in loss values
- Less dramatic fluctuations between iterations
- Faster validation phases after each 1000 iterations

If you still observe instability, you may want to consider reducing the learning rate (`LR`) from 0.0001 to 0.00005.
